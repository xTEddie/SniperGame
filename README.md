# SniperGame

This is a sniper game coded in Python. A Windows Installer Package is included in this repository in /dist for Windows users only.

I do not own any of the pictures used for this project. Most of the pictures came from http://www.flaticon.com/. The background image is taken from http://opengameart.org/content/city-background-repetitive-2. The image of the scope used for the mouse was found on google.
